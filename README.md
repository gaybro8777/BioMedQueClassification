# Dataset

We developed a Hybrid dataset for muli-label biomedical question classification on the basis of lexical answer type. The dataset exploits the pros of two publicaly available corporas: [BioMedLAT corpus](https://github.com/mariananeves/BioMedLAT) provided by Neves et al. and automated dataset generation process by [OAQA system](https://github.com/oaqa/bioasq).
